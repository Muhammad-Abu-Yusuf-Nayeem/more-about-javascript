### Understanding the **Event Loop** and **Call Stack** is crucial in mastering **JavaScript**, especially when dealing with **asynchronous operations** like `setTimeout`, Promises, and async/await.

Here’s a **clear and structured explanation** for both:

---

### 🧠 1. **JavaScript is Single-Threaded**

- JavaScript runs in a **single thread**, which means it can do **one thing at a time**.
- This thread handles all code execution, DOM manipulation, event handling, etc.

---

### 🏗️ 2. **Call Stack**

### What is it?

- The **Call Stack** is a data structure that keeps track of function calls.
- Think of it like a **stack of plates**—last in, first out (LIFO).

### How it works:

1. When you call a function, it's **pushed** onto the stack.
2. When the function finishes, it's **popped** off the stack.

### Example:

```jsx
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

function start() {
  greet(); // pushed
}

start(); // pushed
```

**Call Stack:**

- `start()` is pushed.
- `greet()` is pushed.
- `console.log()` is pushed.
- Then it pops in reverse order.

### 🔁 3. **Event Loop**

### Why do we need it?

- Because JS is single-threaded, we need a system to handle:
  - Asynchronous callbacks
  - Events (clicks, timers)
  - Promises

### Components involved:

1. **Call Stack** (executes functions)
2. **Web APIs** (provided by browser: `setTimeout`, `DOM`, `fetch`, etc.)
3. **Callback Queue** (stores async callbacks)
4. **Microtask Queue** (for Promises)

### How it works:

1. You call `setTimeout()`.
2. JS hands it off to the **browser's Web API**.
3. After the timer expires, the callback goes into the **callback queue**.
4. The **event loop** checks:
   - Is the **call stack empty**?
   - If yes, it takes the callback from the queue and pushes it to the call stack.

### Microtasks (Promises):

- Promise callbacks go to the **Microtask Queue**.
- **Microtasks are given priority** over the normal Callback Queue.

---

### 🧪 Example with `setTimeout` and Promises:

```jsx
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
});

console.log("End");
```

### Output:

```sql
Start
End
Promise
Timeout

```

### Why?

- `console.log("Start")` → stack
- `setTimeout` → Web API → callback queue
- `Promise.then` → microtask queue
- `console.log("End")` → stack
- Microtask queue runs first → `Promise`
- Then callback queue → `Timeout`

### 🔄 4. **Quick Recap**

| Concept         | Role                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Call Stack      | Executes function calls in order                 |
| Web APIs        | Handles async tasks outside JS engin             |
| Callback Queue  | Stores callbacks from Web APIs like `setTimeout` |
| Microtask Queue | Stores Promise `.then` callbacks                 |
| Event Loop      | Moves tasks from queues to stack when it's empty |

---

### 🧰 Why is this Important?

- Helps you understand why some code runs **later**, even with 0ms delay.
- Avoids **callback hell** and helps write cleaner async code.
- Crucial for debugging performance and responsiveness.
