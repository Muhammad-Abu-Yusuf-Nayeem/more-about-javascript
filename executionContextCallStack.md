## üß† 1. Execution Context
An Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

## üì¶ Types of Execution Contexts:
1. Global Execution Context (GEC):

Created when your JavaScript file first runs.

It creates a global object (window in browsers), and sets this to the global object.

Only one global context exists.

2. Function Execution Context (FEC):

Created each time a function is invoked.

Each function has its own context.

It includes:

Local variables

Arguments object

Inner function declarations

Reference to the outer environment

3. Eval Execution Context (rarely used and generally discouraged)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phases of Execution Context:
1. Creation Phase (Memory Allocation):

Sets up the scope, variables, and functions.

Variables are hoisted with undefined.

Function declarations are hoisted entirely.

2. Execution Phase:

Actual code runs.

Variables are assigned values.

Functions are invoked.

üß± 2. Call Stack
The Call Stack is a stack data structure (LIFO) that keeps track of function calls.

üîÑ How It Works:
When a function is called:

A new execution context is created.

It‚Äôs pushed to the call stack.

When the function finishes:

Its context is popped off the stack.

üîç Example:
```javascript

function greet() {
console.log("Hello");
sayName();
}

function sayName() {
console.log("My name is John");
}

greet();
```
## üßæ Call Stack Behavior:
Global Execution Context created and pushed

greet() is called ‚Üí greet Execution Context is pushed

Inside greet, sayName() is called ‚Üí sayName Execution Context is pushed

sayName finishes ‚Üí popped off

greet finishes ‚Üí popped off

Global context remains until end

| Term              | Description                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution Context | Environment where JS is executed, includes memory, scope, `this`, etc.     |
| Call Stack        | Stack that manages execution contexts during function calls.               |
| Hoisting          | Variables declared with `var` and functions are moved to the top of scope. |
